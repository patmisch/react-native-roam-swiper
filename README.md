# react-native-roam-swiper
Testing out communicating and using a ROAM credit card swiper with React Native.

Simply seeing if I could easily get a React Native app communicating with a ROAM pay headphone jack credit card swiper.
Seems to work perfectly. I'll probably push up a fully functional example once I get to that point in my project.
